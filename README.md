Game Name: Sealed

Intent: To create a game about being sealed in a room with a creature. A take on the horror genre.

Narrative Structure: You find yourself in a dark, narrow hallway that you don't recognize, and you are not alone. With you lives a shadowwy monster aiming to hunt you down. Light all of the candles in the area to provide light and hide from the monster.

Mechanics: Move with "WASD" or the arrow keys. Light candles with "E."

Aesthetics: Meant to be a somewhat scary, puzzle-like game. 

Joys: Drawing some of the sprite elements was a lot of fun.

Struggles: Getting the damage system to take affect.
